# All files are copied from [rky0930](https://github.com/rky0930/models/blob/object_detection_yolo/research/object_detection/README.md)

## Added or Updated file list
These files need to be copied into the following `tensorflow/models/` directories
> Hint: To be secure you may want to backup the original files that will be overwritten (although the new files do not change/delete existing code but only extend it)
