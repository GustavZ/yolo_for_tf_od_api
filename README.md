# This is a collection of  all necessary files to include YoloV2 / Darknet to tensorflow's [object_detection repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)

> Note: The original files in the `tensorflow/models/research/object_detection` repo changed since this project (March 2018). Manual copying of the yolo related functions into the updated files of the repo may be necessary!

## Added or Updated file list
These files need to be copied into the following `tensorflow/models/` directories
> Hint: To be secure you may want to backup the original files that will be overwritten (although the new files do not change/delete existing code but only extend it)
